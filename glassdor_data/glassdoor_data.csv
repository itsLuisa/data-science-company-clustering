From the very beginning, one person has been a part of it:

Theo Steil

He founded a scrap – trading company in 1924.

The company received a fresh impulse when Heinrich Gondert took over business in 1964.The yards became larger and the machines became stronger.

Today, the small trading company has grown into a nation – wide operating group with its own recycling management and container service branches.

What has remained is our attitude:
